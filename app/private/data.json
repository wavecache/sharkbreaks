      "description": "(Fetched from https://traveltips.usatoday.com/famous-surfing-beaches-hawaii-107162.html)It was at the turn of the 20th century, on Waikiki Beach – the epicenter of life on Oahu – that Kahanamoku helped make surfing famous by offering lessons to visitors. That tradition continues to this day, thanks to calm waters that make it easy for beginners to try their hand – or feet, rather – at the sport. Sign up for lessons at the one of the booths on the beach and commemorate the occasion by posing for a photo with the famous statue of Kahanamoku.",

      "description": "Army Beach is located on Oahu's northwestern shore, across from the entrance to the Dillingham Airfield. It is near the end of Farrington Highway and at the beginning of the Ka'ena Point State Park. The beach is backed by the Waianae Mountains and is quite scenic. It is a long, sandy beach with azure blue waters. The ocean bottom is mainly rocky with a coral reef, but there is a small reef-free area that's ideal for a dip into the ocean if you would like to swim. Surfing is also possible here. In the winter months (November to March), the waves can reach heights of 15+ feet (4.5+ m), so this is no time for swimming. When the surf is up, strong currents make entering the ocean too dangerous.",

      "description": "Adjacent to the Hotel Haleiwa, but hid away behind a grove of Pride of India trees, fragrant at the time of our visit from the delicate odor of its profuse lilac flowers, is the old Emerson mission homestead, now being demolished, showing quaint features in its structure of pioneer days. Near the old house is the never-failing spring, Kawaipuolo, of legendary fame, which furnishes water to the hotel. Not far from this point, but across the Anahulu stream, stand the ruins of Waialua’s Female Seminary, prominent in this line of missionary work under the Gulicks and the late Mary Green, and the original “Haleiwa” of this place, which name the hotel has appropriately adopted. After the first American Protestant missionaries arrived in 1820, they began establishing stations in the rural areas of O’ahu. The first of these was the Waialua Station, opened in July 1832 by John S. Emerson and his wife. They lived on the bank of Anahulu Stream where Emerson continued his missionary work until 1864, when he retired because of ill health. He died at his home in 1867.",
