      "description": "(Fetched from https://traveltips.usatoday.com/famous-surfing-beaches-hawaii-107162.html)It was at the turn of the 20th century, on Waikiki Beach – the epicenter of life on Oahu – that Kahanamoku helped make surfing famous by offering lessons to visitors. That tradition continues to this day, thanks to calm waters that make it easy for beginners to try their hand – or feet, rather – at the sport. Sign up for lessons at the one of the booths on the beach and commemorate the occasion by posing for a photo with the famous statue of Kahanamoku.",
